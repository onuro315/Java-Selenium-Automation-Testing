ChromeDriver in this project is for Chrome version 88.
If you have problem or want to find version that fits you check: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
After downloading the chromedriver don't forget to replace it at "drivers/chromedriver/".

Before testing the program please don't forget to change USERNAME and PASSWORD at the IConstant.java.
